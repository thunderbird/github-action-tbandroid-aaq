It seems a possibility it's related to the number of characters in the path name. </p><p>In the meantime suggestion is too try this first: If you have any folders with a more lengthy name, then rename to a shorter name: eg: If folder name is 'Online Orders' then rename to 'Orders' as that saves 7 chars (including the space) Or if you have a folder called eg: 'Marks and Spencer' rename as 'M&amp;S' </p><p>Some people may have an issue if they got Thunderbird via the 'Windows App Store' because Windows auot puts the profile in a location which has a longer path directory. If this is your case, then it's advised to uninstall Thunderbird and get a download from the official website:  <a href=""https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/</a> </p><p>You can move the profile if required or set up again in a new profile.
