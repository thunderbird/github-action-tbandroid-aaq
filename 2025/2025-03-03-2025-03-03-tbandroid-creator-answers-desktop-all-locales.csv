Thunderbird for Windows is able to send mail without problems. </p><p>Looking at the source of the headers in mail that fails and comparing with mail that is not blocked, the only differences I can see are that Thunderbird for Android is the only client creating messages IDs where the UUID part of the ID is capitalised - other clients use lower-case letters in the UUID. As far as I can tell either is legitimate. </p><p>The only other difference being the inclusion of the User-Agemt identifying the client as ""Thunderbird for Android"".. </p><p>The error message in MailChannels' bounce is as follows: </p><p>550 5.7.1 [CS] Message blocked.
