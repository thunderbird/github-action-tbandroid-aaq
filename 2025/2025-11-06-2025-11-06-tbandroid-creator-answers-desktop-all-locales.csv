I'm not savvy with any of this stuff and dyslexic have brain damage which makes the whole process to do simple tasks extra difficult. Just asking for help to stop the harassment. Even when I'm using extended unlock no more sign ins for 4 hours, which pleases me greatly. Hate having to lock it. In the perfect world my phone would only get locked when I got to do shopping.
