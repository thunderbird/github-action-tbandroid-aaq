Several days ago sending of emails began failing. Error messages appearing in my Android Notifications say, ""Failed to send some messages"" ""Sender refused"". This is happening on all 4 of the devices my wife and I use. 2 phones and 2 tablets. Optimum is blaming Thunderbird. Thunderbird is still working fine on my Windows computer. It seems that all info regarding turning on Troubleshoot mode is referring to the Windows version as I can't find the ""Help"" menu item in the Android version anywhere. I have reconfigured the accounts in Thunderbird multiple times. The setup of SMTP always seems to end clean with a message of ""Settings saved"". It seems to me that Thunderbird is getting some error code from my ISPs mail server and I am hoping to have some more info to share with their tech support. The version if Thunderbird for Mobile we are on now is 9. I noticed that version 9 was just released on 5/5/2025. Not sure when exactly version 9 was pulled down to my devices. My phone is Android version 10. My tablet is Android version 14. Both are having the same exact issue. Is there a Troubleshoot Mode in the Android Thunderbird app? Is there a log file that could shed some light on the problem? Just tried the Beta version. Same problem. Also tried versions 8.2 and 8.0, Same problem. I still think that it's on <a href=""http://Optonline.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Optonline.net</a> but I'm going to need to do their job for them and find the reason it's stopped working. They are just going to blame Thunderbird. [and yeah, I tried K-9 as well] </p>",itchy100;wsmwk;,true,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:138.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/138.0;kb_visits_prior:[""/en-US/kb/cannot-send-messages""]",2,0,3,,,itchy100
