Import end-to-end key from other device"" and then, if I got it right, try to find the keys which I exported on my laptop from Thunderbird Desktop. </p><p>Are there any precise details on how to find those exported keys and load them into OpenKeychain? Meaning, for instance, do I need to copy/paste the keys from my laptop into the archive of my Android phone and then direct Thunderbird/OpenKeychain to that location to pick them up? </p><p>Any type of details/links/docs/videos with respect to this, will be useful. As well as any explanations in case I understood wrongly and what I am trying to do is not the proper way to proceed. </p><p>Please note: I am not an expert. </p><p>Thank you </p><p>Best Regards </p>",jielink1978;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0;solver_id:4409434,1,0,0,,,jielink1978
