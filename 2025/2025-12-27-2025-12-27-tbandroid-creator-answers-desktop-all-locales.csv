I'm loving it. There's one feature I miss from my previous e-mail client.  I wish the App had that ""Undo"" feature where right after deleting an e-mail or archiving it and things like that you can quickly undo the action.  In other clients, this is just a small popup that shows up for just a few seconds after you take the action. Many times I find that to be useful when you are quickly going through many spam messages, for example, but accidentally delete one you didn't mean to.  </p><p>I can't find such a feature. Is it hidden somewhere, if not where can I make a suggestion for the team to add this? Thanks. -Eli </p>",Eli;platform34;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/143.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/143.0.0.0;os:Android 16",2,0,1,,,
