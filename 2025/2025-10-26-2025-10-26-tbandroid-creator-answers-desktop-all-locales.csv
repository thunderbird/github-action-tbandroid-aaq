All worked, except one account, where it only has an outbox. No inbox, no sent folder, nothing. </p><p>I then Installed Thunderbird mobile, and used the QR code link in the desktop app, to sync to it.  Same issue.  All other accounts work fine, but not that one account. Only an outbox. </p><p>I've logged into the web version of that account, and no restrictions are on folders. And it's only on my phone. On tablet it's fine. </p><p>I can't even choose folders in settings, for sent, etc, as there are none to choose. </p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.
