When accessing the inbox of an individual account directly, the problem does not exist. Example: When I am in the unified inbox overview and all emails are unread, I open one of them and then click the back arrow. All emails still appear as unread (bold). The status only changes from bold to normal once I start scrolling. Furthermore, if I open an email and delete it from within the message view, I am automatically redirected to the overview, but the deleted email still appears there. If I click on it again, nothing happens (as it has already been deleted). Again, the email only disappears from the list once I click elsewhere or scroll. This makes the unified inbox unusable for me at the moment, as I have to manually click through each individual account. Has this bug already been reported?"" </p>",matthias.scheid2;platform34;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10; K) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/143.0.0.0 Mobile Safari/537.36;os:Android Thunderbird Beta 16.0b2",2,0,1,,,
