This is inconvenient for emails with many replies and forwards as they become very long. In addition, the implicit Gmail indentation, makes the scroll length extremely long (email is eventually displayed one character per line). I have one email that I need to scroll hundreds of screens so I can view the attachments. See attached image with the email contents and scroll bar. </p><p>It would help to have a button to scroll to the end or ignore indentation. Both options would be helpful as scrolling to the end allows downloading the attachments and reading the initial email. </p>",ronnyourmatrix;henryblogger24;platform34;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Android 13; Mobile; rv:143.0) Gecko/143.0 Firefox/143.0;os:Android 13 - Samsung Galaxy A32,1,0,1,,,
