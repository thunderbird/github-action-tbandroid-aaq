And why do/did you think this is a fingerprint issue? </blockquote> <p>Hey there. Sorry, I completely forgot about it. </p><p>Not, I'm past this issue. Let me explain. I use Obtainium package manager on Android. It connects to github/gitlab and it allows me to install packages without having to use a playstore, straight from the source. But thunderbird's github instance also provides K9-Mail's package. It just so happens that Obtainium was trying to update my TB's instance with K9's updated package available on github. I just set Obtainium to filter by name and now it only fetches a new package if package's name starts with thunderbird. All good now. Not a Mozilla issue. Thanks a bunch. Cheers </p>",rdscorreia74,false,1,0

However, you could export your Thunderbird contacts and import into your android contacts application of choice. Another choice is set up CardDAV on both PC and android. </p>",wsmwk,false,1,0

This is the only app with this problem and it only does it on my Samsung Galaxy S 25 Ultra phone and not my Samsung Galaxy S10+ tablet on Android 15 UI 7.0. I believe this may have something to do with the new Android operating system. It worked prior to updating. </p>,kevin.prawl,false,0,0
