But why can't users set their own timer so that we can fetch our emails like we can in Thunderbird desktop? Why the difference? This doesn't make sense in settings to me </p><p>Also, look at the screenshots below now I have activated push notifications. Now I have a constant bell notification! When I click the bell I get the first screenshot! Why not just let users set their own time for fetching emails? </p>",TheBudda,false,0,0

I just got it working at last, look at screenshots! </p><p>Thanks for your replies but I disagree with your reply to the Android technical restriction!
