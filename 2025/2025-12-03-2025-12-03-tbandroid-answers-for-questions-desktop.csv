I request you to kindly look into this matter.   Rest all good with the email client. </blockquote> <p>I must admit that I use another mail client 'Aquamail' too. I have those same set of multiple email accounts wherein I receive the intended one, not more than one mail. </p><p>I've thoroughly checked and adjusted the settings of the Thunderbird client.  </p><p>I hope the developer will find and offer the solution for it. </p><p>If anybody else too faced such and solved it, please let me know.
