I'm trying to work with my ISP now to see why mail isn't going through from my phone. They were telling me it was being blocked from leaving their servers by their new-ish outgoing spam filter. But they weren't getting that I  can send same email from desktop and it goes through. Plus, ANY email I've sent from phone in past month has not been received. Waiting for another reply from them.  </p><p>I note in these forums that I'm not the only one with this problem, so I have a feeling it has to do with the way Thunderbird accesses the internet via an Android...? I'm on a Verizon cell plan if that would make any difference. If my ISP (Site5 that's been bought by Network Solutions) solves this I'll let you all know a solution. </p>",mozi3,false,0,1
