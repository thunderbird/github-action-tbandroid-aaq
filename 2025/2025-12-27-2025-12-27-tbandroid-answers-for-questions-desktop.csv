This is found under general settings &gt; interactions &gt; confirm actions. </p><p>The community has suggested this feature on Mozilla Connect.

I think I had seen that, however when you are just scrolling through a bunch of spam or e-mails you don't even feel like opening, I want to go fast. Having to click on the ""Confirm Action"" each time might be annoying, but I'll try it. </p><p>Hopefully the developers can add this soon. Regards. </p>",Eli,false,0,0
