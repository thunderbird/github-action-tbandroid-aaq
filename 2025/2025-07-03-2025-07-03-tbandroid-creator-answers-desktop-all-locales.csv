I've looked to see if there is a ""Starred"" folder but can't find one. I've now discovered that if someone replies to an email that I've starred I get no notification at all, it is just added to the thread. The next time I sort by Star I suddenly see unread replies to previously starred emails - bit of a nightmare! So, is there a way that I can adjust settings to: 1. Leave starred messages in the Inbox (or the folder that I move them to), but allow me to sort by Star when I need to? 2. Have new replies to previously starred messages appear as new notifications, the same way they do for normal emails.  </p><p>Thanks! </p>",kimberly16;,true,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Android 15; Mobile; rv:140.0) Gecko/140.0 Firefox/140.0;os:Android,0,0,0,,,
