My email provider has created a partial but imperfect solution -- he created a proxy server that I can connect to at TLS 1.2 but connections to the main mail server are still at TLS 1.0.  Another problem with that is that I don't receive some of my email because some servers return email rather than make an unsecure connection.  He isn't inclined to fix the latter problem because of the complexity and I'm just a legacy user who has been grandfathered in after the company changed their business model.  So, I guess I am stuck having to move to a new primary email account, anyway.  &lt;sigh&gt; </p>",lnoland,false,0,0
