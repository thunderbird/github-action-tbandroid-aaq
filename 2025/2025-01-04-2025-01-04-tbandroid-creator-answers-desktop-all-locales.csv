Can I set some accounts for full emails and others for headers only?,false,,,false,1708656,1708656;,send-and-receive-email,thunderbird-android;send-and-receive-email;,ArlosDad,"<p>In Thunderbird for Android, when I set up first account, I was asked if I wanted headers only, or full email, and I picked full email. When I set up a second account, I was not given that option, it defaulted to full, and I have not found a way to change that. Can I set that per account, or are all forced to be the same as initial selection? </p><p>I want to keep using the original mail app on my phone for primary email account activity, and use Thunderbird on my tablet for multiple lesser-used accounts. But when using tablet would like to be able to monitor the primary account, and possibly use its address as the sender when forwarding an email from a different account (I do this on desktop version now). Is this possible? Or too much mixing and matching?
