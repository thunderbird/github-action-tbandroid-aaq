I'm very happy with it, i come from BlueMail which is already great but I was not happy with the efficiency of the push notification system. I was missing a lot of emails. Anyway, i decided to try Thunderbird and it solved all my problems. </p><p>But, I have a blocking problem using Thunderbird for Android&nbsp;: When I write a new email and I write the adress mail of the recipient(s), the app doesnt propose any autocompletion/email adress based on emails i recieved/sent. The only way to have this is to have contacts in my adress book which I don't want. This is a feature BlueMail had so I uess it should be possible to have such equivalent with thunderbird&nbsp;?
