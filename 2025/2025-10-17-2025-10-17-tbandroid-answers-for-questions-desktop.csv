Please consider up-voting the idea on Mozilla connect. The Thunderbird team take these into consideration when planning their road-maps and priorities. </p><p><a href=""https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/ideas/ability-to-print-email-messages/idi-p/71885"" rel=""nofollow"">https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/ideas/ability-to-print-email-messages/idi-p/71885</a> </p><p>For now, a possible workaround is to take a screen capture of the email. You could then open this in another app which supports printing. Alternatively open the email in your account providers web portal and print from there. I think Android browsers support printing via the ""share"" feature. </p>",platform34,false,0,0
