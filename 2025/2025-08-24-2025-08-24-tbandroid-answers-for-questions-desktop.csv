There is no ""report as spam"" on the mobile version as far as I know. </blockquote> <p>The gmail for Android mobile has had a spam report for over 5 years. I just double checked the stock app that was on my old Android 10, with the app build date of 2020 and it has the report spam.  I have been using the same modified version of the gmail app since 2021 on my current phone and have used the report spam 5+ times a day (a little less lately) of years. I do not intend for this to come across as sounding rude/mean, just as informative.  </p><p>I just started using TB4A yesterday and the spam is driving me nuts. </p>",gawd21,false,0,0
