I did it and now I have to update my various programs and apps to the new password to access my emails, but the Thunderbird mail program that runs on my smartphone (Redmi Note 13) doesn't allow me to change my password. It almost seems like I have to delete the account and add it again from scratch. Is it absolutely necessary or is there an alternative system? </p>",marcoridge1;platform34;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:145.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/145.0;os:android smartphone,1,0,3,,,

Opening the app or reloading the Inbox takes up to 15-sec to go from a blank screen to showing the messages. I do have all the inboxes indexed on the device but the issue was observed with the standard 25 message limit as well. I have not had similar delays or have been met with a blank screen every time an email app is opened. Is there an ability to speed up the initial and subsequent loading times? It does hamper workflows and skews the perception of the app towards being inefficient or otherwise less than capable compared to similar apps. </p>,acoombs46;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Android 16; Mobile; rv:145.0) Gecko/145.0 Firefox/145.0;os:Android 16,0,0,0,,,
