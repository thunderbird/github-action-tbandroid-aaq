Is the alternative that I delete my android e-mail address and then reinstall it in IMAP with the same e-mail address of my desktop?  If so, will I lose all of my existing Inbox and Sent messages or will they be picked up from my desktop since they are both then on IMAP?  Is there alternatively a way to separately save my current Inbox and Sent messages on my phone? </p>",zbadger,false,0,0

There's no way to backup, export or save them to another location on the phone. </p><p>Pop3 accounts can be configured so emails are either deleted from the server once downloaded to the email client, or always retained on the server. In comparison, emails downloaded via Imap are always retained on the server. </p><p>Your options depend on how you've setup the pop3. Are the emails stored on your phone your <strong>only</strong> copy, or does a copy also exist on the server? </p><p>If the phone holds your only copy, <strong>you will loose these emails </strong> if you remove the account on your phone. If you have all the emails stored on the server,  they will download again to the app via Imap. </p><p>You could install the K9 email client on your phone. This is essentially the same app as Thunderbird and can co-exist at the same time. You could try setting up the imap account on K9 while not affecting the emails stored in Thunderbird. </p>",platform34,false,0,0
