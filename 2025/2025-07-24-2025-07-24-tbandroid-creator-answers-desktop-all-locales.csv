I'm a Thunderbird fan, so when I saw there was a mobile version, I immediately downloaded and installed it. Unfortunately, after a few days, I realized that the push retrieval of incoming emails doesn't work. This feature is essential for me because I need real-time notifications. Did I do something wrong, or are there general problems with this feature? My Android is a Xiaomi Redmi 9 Note Pro. For now, I'm forced to use the ""Edison Software"" app, where the push function works perfectly without having to configure anything. </p>",francesco25;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/138.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",0,0,0,,,
