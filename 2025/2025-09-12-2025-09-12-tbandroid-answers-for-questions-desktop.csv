Google surely has at least a dozen other services maintaining long open network connections. Why does K9 need to tell us about theirs?  If I want to know about them I'll run a NETSTAT app that shows me established network connections.  I certainly don't want to see them in my notifications area. </p>",shawn..,false,0,0

Linked document makes clear: ""New Email notifications are completely separate from the push email service notification"" , which is not very clear in the App.   Also seems at several points, settings I made years ago, were not mapped to new app settings, as I just had to turn off sync on nearly every folder across multiple accounts. </p>",shawn..,false,0,0
