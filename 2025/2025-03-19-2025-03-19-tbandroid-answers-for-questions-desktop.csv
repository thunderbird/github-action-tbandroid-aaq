Here are a few things you can check: </p><p>Verify POP Settings – Make sure your Gmail account is set to allow POP access in Gmail settings (under Forwarding and POP/IMAP). Check Account Configuration – Go to Account Settings in TB and ensure the POP server settings are correct: Incoming server: <a href=""http://pop.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail.com</a> Port: 995 Connection security: SSL/TLS Authentication: OAuth2 (preferred) or Normal Password Manually Download Messages – Try selecting Get Messages or restarting TB to trigger a download. Check for Duplicate Profiles – If you've imported multiple times, there might be duplicate configurations causing conflicts. Try Adding the Account Manually – Instead of importing, try setting up the Gmail POP account manually in TB. If the issue persists, you might also check TB logs (Tools &gt; Activity Manager) for any errors. Let me know how it goes! </p><p>Best, Colin Munro </p>",icolinmunro,false,0,0

The settings are obviously correct since it works and I also checked them.  Whenever I try, I uninstall and install the app so there should be nothing there and I only have One gmail account.  So does the import not work correctly?  It worked for my other 2 non-gmail imap accounts.  I like it as POP, can't stand GMAIL with IMAP and it's only me so I don't care about IMAP.  Thanks. </p>",smsterling99,false,0,0

If you want to use Gmail POP on multiple devices, Google recommends using POP recent mode instead of POP normal mode. </p><p>The following links might be helpful: 1.

I will check out those links.  Will they help?  Thanks.  Still have not tried to setup TB 4 A for the gmail account manually, as someone suggested... </p>",smsterling99,false,0,0

I think there is a problem with scanning the code and then letting TB4A configure it that way.  I added it ""manually"" and it knew all the settings from gmail and it worked.  And as far as IMAP vs POP, the current app on my phone does use Imap and also now with TB4A.  My PC TB still uses POP, as I like it that way. </p><p>So I guess now I will see how it looks and works.  Hopefully it has some formatting options in it.  Sorry I did not do enough research.  Thanks for the 2 suggestions. </p><p>Sam in FL </p>",smsterling99,false,0,0
