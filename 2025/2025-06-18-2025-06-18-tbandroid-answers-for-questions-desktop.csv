Let's take this step by step to identify the cause and find a solution. 1. Check your network connection </p><p>The error messages ""network error"" and ""connection reset"" could indicate a temporary network issue. Try the following steps: </p><p>Check that your internet connection is stable. </p><p>Reboot your router and computer. Test if you can reach other websites or services. </p><p>2. Check your server settings </p><p>BT Internet requires specific settings to connect to their mail server. Make sure you have the correct settings in Thunderbird: </p><p>Incoming server (IMAP): Server name: <a href=""http://imap.btinternet.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.btinternet.com</a> Port: 993 Secure connection with: SSL/TLS </p><p>Outgoing server (SMTP): Server name: <a href=""http://smtp.btinternet.com"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.btinternet.com</a> Port: 465 Secure connection with: SSL/TLS </p><p>You can check these settings by going to Tools &gt; Account Settings &gt; Server Settings. 3. Check that BT Internet is not running maintenance </p><p>Sometimes email providers run maintenance on their servers, which can cause temporary outages. Check the BT Internet website or their status page for updates. 4. Check that Thunderbird is up to date </p><p>Make sure you are running the latest version of Thunderbird. Older versions may have problems with modern security protocols. 5. Test with a different email client </p><p>To check if the problem is specific to Thunderbird, try using a different email client (such as Outlook or the BT Internet webmail interface). If the problem occurs there, it is likely to be a problem with the BT Internet server. 6. Contact BT Internet </p><p>If the above steps do not resolve the problem, contact BT Internet again. Specifically ask them for: </p><p>Confirmation that their IMAP and SMTP servers are operational. Help configuring Thunderbird. </p><p>7. Workaround: Use Webmail </p><p>If you urgently need to view emails while you wait for a resolution, you can use the BT Internet webmail interface: <a href=""https://webmail.btinternet.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://webmail.btinternet.com</a> </p><p>Hopefully this helps! If you have any questions or need more information, please let me know. </p><p>Kind regards, Kaasplank3333 </p>",Cheesy-studio123,false,0,0
