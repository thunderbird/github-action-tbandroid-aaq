On a hunch, I signed on to the MS-exchange server in a browser, and discovered that all of my sent emails, including both those sent from TB/Android as well as from TB/desktop, actually are in the Sent Items folder on the outlook server.  So my original assumption that TB/Android wasn't uploading sent emails to the server was wrong.  (sorry, my bad.) </p><p>My problem still exists though;  I still can't see emails that are sent from TB/Android in the ""Sent"" folder of my TD/desktop app.  Those emails do not get pulled down from the server when the periodic sync occurs, and clicking on ""Get Messages"" does not pull them in either.  I'm not sure why. Is it possible there's confusion between ""Sent"" (in TB) and ""Sent Items"" (on the MS server)?  Just a wild guess. </p><p>Any help / suggestions would be much appreciated.  Thanks. </p>",bruceh1473,false,0,0

My TB/desktop account configuration was originally set up with ""Sent"" as the name of the folder where sent emails are placed.  (I don't know why, maybe that's the default;  but it always worked anyway so I didn't question it.)   The Outlook server calls it ""Sent Items"".  To fix this, I had to modify the account settings in TB to subscribe to ""Sent Items"", and unsubscribe from ""Sent"".  After doing that, all sent emails are visible on both desktop and Android TB installations, regardless of which one the emails were sent from. </p>",bruceh1473,false,0,0

It was at 'automatic (none). Apparently the folder settings do not come over from the desktop settings when you use the QR code. </p>",jim486,false,0,0
