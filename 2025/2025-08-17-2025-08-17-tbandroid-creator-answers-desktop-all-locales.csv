The number of new e-mails would appear on the TB icon on my screen. But recently this hasn't happened. I can still download e-mails, but I have to open the TB app first, whereupon (after a short delay) any new e-mails download without any further action from me. I didn't knowingly change anything. How can I get back to the original status, please? </p>",trhdawson;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:142.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/142.0;os:Android 14,0,0,0,,,
