I followed the prompts to export the settings and that all seemed to work but the app won't connect to the incoming and outgoing servers. I've checked and the details are the same as the desktop (via Bridge) but it just says failed to connect every time. </p><p>I'm also only showing an outbox and no other folders in the app. I searched the forum and found others with this issue but no solutions. Is this a dead end and I'm better off going back to Outlook or is there a solution to this? </p><p>Thanks in advance 😊 </p>",A.dee;platform34;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10; K) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/142.0.0.0 Mobile Safari/537.36;os:Android;solver_id:7229489",1,0,0,,,
