And didn't realize till now that people aren't getting my emails. They show up in Sent. But aren't going to recipient. I have a number of emails and same issue for all of them.  </p><p>TB on Windows works fine. And test email from phone to another of my emails shows up on my desktop.  </p><p>This is an urgent issue!!! I hope I don't have to reinstall the Samsung email on phone that wants mic access despite me not using talk. But I need to be able to email from phone! </p><p>Solutions???!!! </p>,mozi3,false,0,0

I couldn't wait months for help with such a crucial problem. </p><p>I get that Mozilla programs are supported by volunteers, but I think someone (maybe an AI?) needs to perform some meaningful triage on requests. I've got a request for a Firefox for Android bug, but it's a small thing. I understand that it will be a long time before someone gets to it.  </p><p>This problem was different. I couldn't wait even a week once I saw it; I had been out of touch for weeks without knowing it. So I have been using FairEmail since August. It's a bit cluttered, but it works reliably. </p>",khindall,false,0,0

The message body and attachments are fetched only when you open or request them. This is exactly the space-saving behavior you’re describing. </p>",Thundamike,false,0,0
