You brought it home that this is indeed the closest solution. Until the Cc option is included.  It does give what I wanted -a return to my mailbox with each Send so I can confirm successful send. I save these as .eml to a disk folder but must be careful to save from the Sent box (not the Inbox) as this is the place where the Bcc header is preserved. </p>,ssum,false,0,0
