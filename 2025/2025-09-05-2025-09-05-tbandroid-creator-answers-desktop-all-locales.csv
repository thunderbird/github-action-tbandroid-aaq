I expected this to work out-of-the-box, but it has never worked and I've never been able to figure out how to tweak settings to make it work. I thought the unified view might allow what I want, but if I enable my ""Inbox"" and ""Sent"" (and Archive) folders to be unified I get a merged view of their content but the threaded view of emails does not work, I sent items separate from replies received to these. </p><p>I need help how to fix this because it has become severely limiting and it is pushing me to switch to another client if I can't find a solution. </p><p>Thanks, Szilard </p>",sin.pecado;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:140.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/140.0;os:Android 16,0,0,0,,,
