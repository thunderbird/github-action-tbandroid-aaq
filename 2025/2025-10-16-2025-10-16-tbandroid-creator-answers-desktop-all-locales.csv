I've set the Sent folder to sync (as well as the Inbox). Pressing the sync button just spins the indicator, but doesn't actually sync. When I try to move or copy messages, an error comes up saying that messages can't be copied or moved that aren't synconised. How can all my messages (sent, inbox, everything) be synced so that I can see them everywhere? I've just turned on sync debugging, will see the results soon. </p>",firefox1748;platform34;sophiaisabell6789;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10; K) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/141.0.0.0 Mobile Safari/537.36;os:Android;kb_visits_prior:[""/en-US/kb/configure-push-email-thunderbird-android""]",9,1,3,,,
