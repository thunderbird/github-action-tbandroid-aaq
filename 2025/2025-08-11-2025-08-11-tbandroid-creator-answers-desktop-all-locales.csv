Have been an ignorant gmail user for years. Now, I am testing new grounds, and decided to move to more privacy focused email client. Only been using thunderbird for few weeks, but now it seems that my inbox is getting more confusing/confused that you would normally expect. Have not looked in too deep, but it seems that 10 year old emails appear as new in inbox. Say newest email is received on Sunday, and it says Sunday, but I was not expecting any email on Sunday, from that particular sender. So I looked ant the date and time, expecting it to be a spam, but this particular emais seems legit, however, the received date is Monday, 8 June, 2015. And that's not the first eMail from the past. I have got few more down in the inbox, like last week's, but they actually are from 2015. How is it even possible? I also have few new emails, so it's a real mishmash of new and old  in the past few days. The only thing I can think of, is that I have changed the sync messages from (if I remember correctly) 6 months to anytime recently. Any ideas or hints? </p>",qwantusx;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Android 15; Mobile; rv:143.0) Gecko/143.0 Firefox/143.0;os:Android,0,0,0,,,
