At last I could use Thunderbird on my phone and tablet as well as my desktop!  I've used Bluemail (the best of the rest in my view) on my mobile for some time and am currently comparing its performance side by side with Thunderbird for Mobile, having just installed the latter.   In terms of fetching message I'm actually finding Bluemail much speedier at the moment and don't know why this is so.  For example, I can often read incoming emails on Bluemail five minutes or more before they arrive via Thunderbird.  So far as I know, I think I've tweaked all the necessary settings on Thunderbird but may be overlooking something.  Can anybody suggest a way to speed up Thunderbird?  I'm more than keen to keep on using it. </p><p>Cheers, </p><p>Grant </p>",egtaylor1;shopov.bogomil;,false,false,false,";solver_id:2818460;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/138.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/138.0.0.0",2,0,0,,,
