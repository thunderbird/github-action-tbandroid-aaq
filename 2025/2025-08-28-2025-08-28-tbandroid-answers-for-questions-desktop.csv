Is it that you want Thunderbird to remember content from previous emails so that it has a suggested recipient for a new email on the subject? That feature is not there, but maybe I am misunderstanding. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

From what I can see, the Windows app has that handy e-mail auto-complete, but the Android one still doesn’t. On the newest Android release there’s no sign of it &amp; I still have to type the whole email or pick someone from my contacts. I’d rather not clog up my address book with every address I might ever email, so I’ll just hang on until the Android app catches up with the Windows version. </p>",ppio,false,0,0

Otherwise, you have to type or copy-and-paste addresses each time, which is awkward and frustrating. The Windows version automatically remembers addresses you’ve used before and suggests them for autofill, but the Android app doesn’t. To fix this, the same autofill feature needs to be added to Android. </p>",ppio,false,0,0

With my desktop version, I have no trouble sending and receiving emails. I am using version 142.0 (64-bit) of Thunderbird, and the desktop computer is Windows 10.    I have 2 issues sending emails.    First issue, my Pixel 9 Pro XL does not send emails anymore.  It was working fine until recently.  The email is stalled in the outbox.  I tried reloading the outgoing server settings, I get an error message; see attached error message.  My Android receives emails fine, but will not send them.  My phone syncs well with my desktop.  However, the outbox doesn't sync, so I can't send the stalled emails from the desktop when I'm back in my office.    Second issue is my POS program (Windward Software System 5) stopped sending out emails as well.  I worked with the tech department at the software company, and they said it isn't an issue with them, nothing has changed with them, no upgrades or changes on their end.  Some of our older machines here, that haven't received the recent upgrade with Thunderbird, are still sending emails fine.  Just a couple of computers are having this trouble of not sending emails from out POS software, it's the ones that have received the Thunderbird upgrade.     For the outgoing settings, we are using the default port 465, and the connection security is SSL/TLS.  Authentication method: is a normal password.  I am hoping you have an answer for me.   .    Thank you,  Kathi McNally </blockquote>",kathi15,false,0,0
