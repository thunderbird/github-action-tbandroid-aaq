The only issue, and please take a look about that, the minimum sync for the emails are 10 minutes (see attached photo) which is too high when you are expecting a new email. Please reduce the time into 1 minute and to have a notification for income email.  Kind regards Charalampos Karampasis </p>",harriskepix;Yu5tiqX9og;,true,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/136.0.0.0 Safari/537.36;os:to whom it may concern",1,0,1,,,
