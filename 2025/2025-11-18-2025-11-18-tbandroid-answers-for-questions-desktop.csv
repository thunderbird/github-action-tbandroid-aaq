I am really commenting on how the side bar does not get immediately out of the way after choosing a different account to reveal the newly selected account's inbox - OPENED.  </p><p>As is now, I either have to tap the inbox icon (already shown as selected), swipe the sidebar left, or tap outside the sidebar on the right to make the sidebar slide away. </p><p>In the old K-9, you tapped on the account and the sidebar disappeared to the left revealing the open inbox without need for any other user action. </p><p>It is minor, I know. But if, like me, you change accounts many times a day, it rapidly becomes irritating. </p><p>Best </p>",whitedavidp,false,0,0

I wonder if that supposition is actually true though? Has it been measured/polled/etc? Or is this just a theory? </p><p>K-9 didn't do this. So I wonder what exactly prompted the change? </p><p>Maybe it is just me. But I feel like when most people deal with their email, the inbox is where they want to go first after changing accounts. Desktop TB avoids all this by letting you click directly on the folder. So no real help there as a model. </p><p>Best! </p>",whitedavidp,false,0,0
