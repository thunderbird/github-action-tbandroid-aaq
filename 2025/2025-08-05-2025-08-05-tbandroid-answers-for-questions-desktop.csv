Spectrum’s outgoing mail settings are quite specific, so even a small mismatch can prevent sending. </p><p>Here’s what to double-check: </p><p>SMTP Server – <a href=""http://mail.twc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.twc.com</a> or the server address provided by Spectrum for your region. </p><p>Port – Use 587 with STARTTLS (or TLS) encryption. </p><p>Authentication – Make sure “Use same username and password as incoming” is enabled. </p><p>Username Format – Sometimes Spectrum requires the full email address as the username (e.g., you@example.com). </p><p>ISP Restrictions – If you’re on a different internet provider’s network, Spectrum may block outgoing mail unless you’re using authentication with the correct port and encryption. </p><p>I remember reading a troubleshooting article on <a href=""https://universalmagzines.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Universal Magzines online</a> about Spectrum’s email setup in Thunderbird, and it highlighted that re-entering credentials in the SMTP section (not just the incoming section) often resolves this issue. </p><p>Once the SMTP settings are updated correctly, sending should work without any further tweaks. </p>",adnankhanaladin,true,0,0
