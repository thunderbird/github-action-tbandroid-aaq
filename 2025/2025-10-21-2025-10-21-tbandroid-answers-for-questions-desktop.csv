It released yesterday on Github and may take a few days before it's available in app stores. The version should resolve your issue. </p><p>The issue was due to a regression in HTML and table handling which the TB devs have reversed. </p>,platform34,false,0,0

Because both accounts have been working well for some time on my PC, I thought I would root around for extra settings within Thunderbird on the PC and found 'export settings to Android'. A QR code appeared with 'scan to get link' (as far as I remember it).  So now the Android is showing both accounts, as required. </p>",info13170,false,0,0
