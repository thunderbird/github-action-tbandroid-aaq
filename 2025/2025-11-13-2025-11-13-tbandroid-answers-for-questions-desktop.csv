If you sure that all settings were okay to use both of these device’s ,okay. </p><p>I do think that the telephone is doing well.

These subjects are not related to wrong named receiving maps for that mobile what could give other error messages. </p><p>Greetings Googlethunderbird. </p>",Googlethunderbird.,false,0,0
