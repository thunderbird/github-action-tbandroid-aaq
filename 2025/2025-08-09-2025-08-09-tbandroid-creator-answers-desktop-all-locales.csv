Collect incoming, non scam names and addresses as email comes in. Use these to auto complete outgoing emails, as the desktop version does...at least my desktop version does. This would be so helpful to me. I use my phone to do emails while I am travelling. Having auto search-fill would be very helpful in this situation where fumbling thru past emails to find an email address is very frustrating.  Cheers for your product. I do like it which is why I have it on both my phone and desktop.
