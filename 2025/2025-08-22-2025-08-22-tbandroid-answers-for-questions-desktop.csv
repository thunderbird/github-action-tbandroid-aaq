I just did what you did and indeed the only folder I saw was the outbox. Then I realized the passwords are not set and after I added them and refreshed the view all was good! </p><p>Can you see if this is your case. In the file export there are no passwords stored. </p>,shopov.bogomil,false,0,0

Initially syncing with Gmail works and new emails show in Thunderbird almost immediately, but after a day or so new emails don't show, even though they are in Gmail. Weird cos for the first day or so all works perfectly. Battery is unrestricted, push is enabled etc. </p>",jostian,false,0,0
