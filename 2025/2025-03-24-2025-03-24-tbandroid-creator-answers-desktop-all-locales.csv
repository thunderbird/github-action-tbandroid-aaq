The email is sent, but not saved in the sent mail. Sending emails via computer (Thunderbird) or after logging in via the web interface works, emails are saved in the sent mail. The problem is only in the mobile application and only for 1 account. The other 2 accounts (gmail and center) work without problems, emails are saved in the sent mail. I tried changing the server settings for sent mail in the given account - without success. Has anyone encountered a similar problem? Thank you </p>",robo844;Yu5tiqX9og;,true,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10; K) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/134.0.0.0 Mobile Safari/537.36",4,0,1,,,robo844
