One of them is a T-Online Email address. Recently it appears to have stopped syncing the folders only for this account. I still get emails in the inbox but all the folders are empty. It only says ""Bis zu 100 weitere abrufen"" (request up to 100 more) but tapping that doesn't make a difference. In the settings I have the sync set to everything without limitation. </p><p>I tested the same account with K9 (v11.1) and Google Mail and in both all the folders have their content. </p><p>Does anyone have the same issue or any suggestions?
