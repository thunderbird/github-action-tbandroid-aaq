I saw the update to 11.1 from my current 10.1 this morning. So I jumped on it with excitement! Suffice it to say that, thanks to my rooted phone and Neo Backup, I have returned to 10.1... </p><p>My main problems are with the ""hierarchical folders"" - especially in gmail, which is the only place I see these bad changes (I have outlook and yahoo accounts as well): </p><p>1. There should be an option to turn use of ""hierarchical folders"" OFF in an account. I sure don't see that. 2. If ""hierarchical folders"" are to be insisted-upon, the state of opened folders in the hierarchy should be persisted - at the very least within a given TB session - but it would be more ideal across TB sessions. 3. If you tap on the un-opened ""hierarchy"" folder, you get a completely worthless page (see attached). WTH? 4. There should be a way to indicate that a given ""hierarchy"" folder should NOT be hidden in the drop-down but should be placed at the top, outside the hierarchy. Would would have hoped that the ""Show At Top"" setting in the Manage Folders would do this, but it does NOT. </p><p>I didn't go much beyond this. I realized right then that this was not the update for me. So I tried to use the back button to return from TB to the launcher's home page (so I could go to Neo Backup and recover). Guess what? The back button no longer exits from TB to the launcher in 11.1 as it did in 10.1. I sure did not see this in the release notes. </p><p>This is a shame really. </p>",whitedavidp;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:135.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/135.0;os:Android 12,1,0,2,,,

With my desktop version, I have no trouble sending and receiving emails. I am using version 142.0 (64-bit) of Thunderbird, and the desktop computer is Windows 10.   </p><p>I have 2 issues sending emails.   </p><p>First issue, my Pixel 9 Pro XL does not send emails anymore.  It was working fine until recently.  The email is stalled in the outbox.  I tried reloading the outgoing server settings, I get an error message; see attached error message.  My Android receives emails fine, but will not send them.  My phone syncs well with my desktop.  However, the outbox doesn't sync, so I can't send the stalled emails from the desktop when I'm back in my office.   </p><p>Second issue is my POS program (Windward Software System 5) stopped sending out emails as well.  I worked with the tech department at the software company, and they said it isn't an issue with them, nothing has changed with them, no upgrades or changes on their end.  Some of our older machines here, that haven't received the recent upgrade with Thunderbird, are still sending emails fine.  Just a couple of computers are having this trouble of not sending emails from out POS software, it's the ones that have received the Thunderbird upgrade.     For the outgoing settings, we are using the default port 465, and the connection security is SSL/TLS.  Authentication method: is a normal password.  I am hoping you have an answer for me.   Please don't share the attachment with the community forums.  Everything else will be fine.   </p><p>Thank you, </p><p>Kathi McNally </p>",kathi15;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/139.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",1,1,3,,,
