I have contacted the sys admin before and was told they are planning to upgrade ""some day"" but that was over two years ago so I'm not optimistic. </p><p>I've gotten Thunderbird desktop to work with the account by downgrading the minimum TLS level.  Recently, I've started using Thunderbird mobile on my phone (as the latest Gmail app update stopped working with my email account -- no doubt for the same reason) and it was working fine but I just bought a new phone and transferred my apps to it.  I set Thunderbird mobile up exactly the same way as I did on my old phone, but it is refusing to sign in, citing a protocol problem (so I'm suspecting the stupid TLS 1.0 issue).  I don't understand why this worked on my old phone but not on the new one -- the old one is on an earlier version of Android -- could that be it?  (Both versions of Thunderbird mobile say they are version 11.1). </p><p>So, what can I do about this?  There doesn't seem to be any way to downgrade the TLS version on the mobile software.  Spending the next two months going through every account I've opened on the internet and changing the associated email account probably isn't as fun as it sounds and I'm inclined to not try finding out.  Persuading my email provider to move into the 21st century is probably easier said than done.  If I can't change Thunderbird mobile to fix this, does anyone know of another Android email app which would work?  Not being able to access my emails on my cell phone would be a significant issue for me. </p>",lnoland;wsmwk;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/139.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",2,0,0,,,wsmwk
