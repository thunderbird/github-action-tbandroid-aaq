The first namespace is ""/"" - effectively ""INBOX"".  The second is a public namespace shared by numerous persons.  Let's call it ""Public"" for purposes of discussion. </p><p>Thunderbird desktop correctly identifies that I have access to both namespaces and I can see folders in each.  On Thunderbird Android (beta), if I ""Auto-detect IMAP namespace"" it correctly finds ""/"" (i.e., my private INBOX) but does not see the ""Public"" folders.  If I turn off ""Auto-detect IMAP namespace"" and enter the IMAP path prefix explicitly (i.e., ""Public"") it can then see the Public folders, but not my private INBOX. </p><p>The workaround has been to create two accounts in T-Bird Android, one for INBOX and the other for Public.  This works, but is not ideal. </p><p>Either the ""Auto-detect IMAP namespace"" needs to be made more like Thunderbird desktop (able to detect multiple namespace paths) or there needs to be a syntax that allows a user to specify multiple paths.  E.g., ""/;Public"" or something like that.  Maybe such a syntax already exists?  I couldn't find anything in the documentation about it. </p><p>Thanks for creating T-Bird Android.
