I'd like to configure it so that when I delete a message it is moved to my Trash IMAP folder. This is equivalent to the setting I've been using for years on my various desktop versions of Thunderbird. However the ""When I delete a message"" configuration option only offers me the following choices: </p> <ul><li> Do not delete on server </li><li> Delete from server </li><li> Mark as read on server </li></ul> <p>Why isn't ""Move to folder"" available as a choice? What do I need to do to enable that option? I did go into the ""Folders"" configuration and change the ""Trash folder"" from ""Automatic (Trash)"" to ""Trash"" in the list of IMAP folders for that account but that did not help. </p>",jdennis71;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/140.0.0.0 Safari/537.36;kb_visits_prior:[""/en-US/kb/gmail-thunderbird-android"", ""/en-US/kb/thunderbird-android-import""]",0,0,0,,,
