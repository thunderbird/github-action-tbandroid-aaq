This displays the selected email account and it's folders.  </p><p>Emails from folders (any account) with ""Unify"" enabled continue to be displayed within the Unified Inbox. </p><p>The design was changed to move the Unified Inbox under it's own Unified account header. It's part of ongoing development that will in time bring other Unified folders under the same header, such as Unified Sent, Unified Draft, Unified trash etc. </p>",platform34,false,0,0
