I am very happy with it apart from the fact I have struggled and been unable to set up archive folders as I have on my desk top version.    I find this a great boon in keeping my inbox uncluttered and accessing old information easily.    On my desktop I have folders to archive by year and by specific entities.   I am sure I am missing something very obvious so any help would be appreciated.
