So I changed a setting on my POP3 laptop under settings&gt;account settings &gt; server settings: </p><p>1. Leave messages on server - This was unchecked and I checked it.  I also checked: For at most 1 day. </p><p>By doing this, I assume messages will stay on the server until: </p><p>1.  I delete a message 2. If I have not manually deleted a message, it will be deleted automatically after a day on the server. </p><p>On my IMAP phone client under Settings &gt; Account &gt; Fetching mail  I left the following settings as is: </p><p>1. Sync server deletions - This is checked. 2. Mark as read when deleted - This is checked.  Not sure how to interpret this. Is this mark as read on Server or on my phone&nbsp;? 3. When I delete a message - The option is set to Delete from server 4. Erase deleted messages on server - This option is set to Immediately. </p><p>With these settings I assume I will see ALL messages on my phone, and they will disappear from my phone when I either delete a message from my POP3 laptop client, OR the messages are deleted automatically on the server after a day based on my POP3 laptop client settings. </p><p>As to whether my phone client is setup as an IMAP client: When I go to Settings &gt; Account &gt; Fetching mail &gt; Incoming server, there is no definitive setting that says IMAP.  The ONLY setting I see that mentions IMAP is: Auto-detect IMAP namespace and that setting is checked.  After googling how to setup IMAP on my Thunderbird phone client, I found that setting the port SEEMED to control whether it is IMAP.  I am not using any security for my emails, so I am using port 143 with the same server, authentication, username, and password as my POP3 laptop client. The only difference is I am using port 143 for IMAP on my phone and port 110 for POP3 on my laptop client.  </p><p><br> If I am misinterpreting these settings, please let me know. </p>",ksands,false,0,0
