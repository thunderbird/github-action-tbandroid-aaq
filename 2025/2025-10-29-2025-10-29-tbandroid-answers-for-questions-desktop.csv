I don't know if deleting the email itself does this. </p><p>If freeing up the storage space is key, you could clear Thunderbird's cache from Androids settings. This would clear downloaded attachments and images associated with ALL emails, but not the emails themselves, assuming an imap connection. </p><p>Clicking the ""download complete message"" button on an email will retrieve it's attachments again. Same for ""Show remote images"". </p><p>Hope that helps. </p>",platform34,false,1,0
