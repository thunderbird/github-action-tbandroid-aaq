IMAP Mailboxes are on <a href=""http://freenet.de"" rel=""nofollow"">freenet.de</a> and <a href=""http://gmx.de"" rel=""nofollow"">gmx.de</a> which are quite common here in Germany. </p><p>BTW, K-9 12.1 has the same problem but (at least) does not crash anymore. My old tablet still works, as it seems to be stuck at K-9 10.1 for some reason&nbsp;:-) </p>",sven_gosslau,false,0,0

I also went through all the individual folder setting to try to get it to sync.  I'm a zero inbox guy and all my messages are moved out to folders.  For me this is a deal breaker and I've moved back to BlueMail until this is fixed.  I'm signed up to monitor the thread. </p>,spiperman2,false,0,0

Is what host we are on useful for diagnosis? </blockquote> <p>To answer my own question, hopefully for the benefit of anyone else that comes here - yes, there is. <a href=""https://github.com/thunderbird/thunderbird-android/issues/9567#issuecomment-3183117087"" rel=""nofollow"">On github GerryArqIT </a> suggested a workaround: disabling ""Auto-detect IMAP namespace"" and leaving IMAP path prefix empty, the problem is gone. Which is under settings/(account)/fetching mail/Incoming server Which works perfectly for me.  And it looks like they are working on it. </p>",garyt,false,2,0
