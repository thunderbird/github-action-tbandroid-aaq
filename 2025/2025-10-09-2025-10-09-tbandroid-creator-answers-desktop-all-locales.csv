When I get a new email I will briefly be able to see the new email subject as well as other emails that are sitting in the box that have already been read. It also will show the current email and previous emails in the non-bold text for a while.  </p><p>This is really frustrating as I needed to work like a normal app showing things sitting in the inbox that I've already been read at a glance. </p><p>Yes, inbox has been selected into UniFi so that way it should be shown.  </p><p>Unless I misunderstand how to use Thunderbird for Android. I can't see where the problem lies. </p><p>I have uploaded a screenshot of the widget that shows unified inbox at the top and the blank area below. This box gets populated as I stated above only when new emails come.  </p><p>Additional shots show when a new email comes in. It suddenly all appears  </p><p>The last shot shows that it redraws after reading the new email so that all the red emails are in bold  </p><p>I have clipped these screen images to protect my privacy on other emails sitting in the display  </p><p>And helps.
