Partially installed all my accounts using the QR codes from desktop saying i would enter the passwords later but then couldn't find where to enter the passwords! (I did find it for one account but then couldnt find it again to do the rest). I reinstalled using the QR code from my desktop Thunderbird. (Have lots of accounts so had to do more than one QR code). After each code was 'done' there was a list of accounts  and the option of enter passwords or later but the enter passwords was greyed out. I found out that  selecting each account in the list allowed me to enter the password for that account (didn't have to for every account...google seemed to be easier than ms hotmail/outlook), it also directed me to a link to allow Thunderbird to access that account. I had to do this for each account after each QR code but now I have full access to every account...  Couldn't find info about this in the help section etc - might be something the developers could make clearer...still now loving this as much as my Thunderbird desktop - makes managing multiple email accounts much easier </p>",lucky67,false,0,1
