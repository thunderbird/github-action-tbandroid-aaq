I have been using Thunderbird forever and want to continue to do so! </p><p>On my Android Phone (Pixel 7a) with Android 15  I am experiencing a breakdown of the sync of my inbox of my gmail. This is one of two email adresses I am using (hotmail is the other) and the Gmail-Inbox and the gmail-spam box are the only two synced folders. </p><p>This can work for days or even weeks, but then suddenly is stops syncing. I do not notice this until looking at my inbox from another device. I then have to sync manually to get the sync going again. Changing between WiFi ang 4G/5G does not make the sync startup again. </p><p>I have set the batterysaving-settings off for T-bird and not changing any other settings which might affect this behaviour. </p><p>Can you help please?
