I have just downloaded Thunderbird for Android - I always used it in the past, when I had a 'proper' laptop, so was really pleased to see that it was now available.  I use a Bluetooth keyboard with my tablet, which transforms using the tablet into something like a laptop.  However, my shortcut keys don't seem to work with Thunderbird, like they used to.  I can't create bold or italics (there's nothing like the little icons at the top of this box, for example), or move up and down the screen with keystrokes.  I can find nothing in the help about this topic.  Please can someone help me, or is the Thunderbird for Android of very limited utility? </p><p>Thank you in advance. </p><p>Annie </p>",annieatanchor;,true,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Android 13; Mobile; rv:135.0) Gecko/135.0 Firefox/135.0;ff_version:135.0;os:Android,0,0,0,,,
