Here are a few things you can check: </p><p>1. **Profile location:** </p><pre>  * Go to **Help → More Troubleshooting Information → Profile Folder → Open Folder**.   * Make sure your *Local Folders* data (usually in `Mail/Local Folders`) is actually there and not being stored in a temporary or roaming location. </pre> <p>2. **Check permissions:** </p><pre>  * Ensure that the profile folder isn’t marked as *read-only* and that you have full write permissions to it. </pre> <p>3. **Antivirus or cleaner software:** </p><pre>  * Some antivirus or “system cleaner” tools can remove or block Thunderbird data. Try adding Thunderbird’s profile folder to your antivirus exclusion list. </pre> <p>4. **Rebuild your profile (if needed):** </p><pre>  * Close Thunderbird.   * Copy the contents of your `Mail/Local Folders` folder somewhere safe.   * Create a new Thunderbird profile using the **Profile Manager** (`thunderbird.exe -P`), then move your saved Local Folders data into the new profile’s `Mail/Local Folders` folder. </pre> <p>After that, restart Thunderbird and check if the folders persist after closing and reopening. </p><p>Kind regards, Rahmat </p>",rahmatbl.1122,false,0,0
