Now, whenever I try to click on ""share"" (say for a Wikipedia article), the keyboard doesn't show, unless I press the ""To"" button. The keyboard ALWAYS came up automatically before a few days ago. Also, at the same time, when I try to send (for example) pictures, only ONE will get sent. The other aren't included in the email, and there is only ONE attachment. I'm not sure if the problem is related, but it's a weird coincidence. All this started about 3 days ago, and I'm not sure eif it updated or not, but I'm using version 10.

Not sure the name. I just mean system colours are picked up from wallpaper and I have already my own set of colours that apply to most apps but not Thunderbird. My question is: when TB will support this?  Should I post this as feature request?
