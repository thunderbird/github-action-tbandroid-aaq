Recently, I started actively using the Android version as well. From time to time, I also make donations to support the project, since it’s very important to me that Thunderbird continues to grow. </p><p>I’d like to share a suggestion: it would be very convenient if attachments in emails were displayed right after the subject line, instead of at the bottom of the entire conversation. In long email threads, it can be inconvenient to scroll all the way down just to open an attached file. </p><p>I’d be very grateful if you could consider this improvement. Thank you in advance for your feedback and for your excellent work on Thunderbird! </p><p>Best regards, Aleks </p>",a.govorkovmmibs;shopov.bogomil;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10; K) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/140.0.0.0 Mobile Safari/537.36;os:Android",1,0,0,,,
