I have it set up so that reading/opening a msg leaves it's status as unread. I use read status in the msg list so that I can tell what I have dealt with and what is still to be actioned.  With Tbird Android, which I use as well as desktop, reading or opening a msg turns it's status to read and it then gets lost among other msg on both platforms. Can't find a setting to change this so that both platforms act the same. Or a workround/change in my workflow. </p>",david903;Yu5tiqX9og;,true,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Android 14; Mobile; rv:136.0) Gecko/136.0 Firefox/136.0,1,0,1,,,
