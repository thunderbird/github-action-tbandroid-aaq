You can help promote the idea by up-voting the suggestion at the link below. <a href=""https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/ideas/option-to-display-email-address-plus-associates-name/idi-p/85135"" rel=""nofollow"">https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/ideas/option-to-display-email-address-plus-associates-name/idi-p/85135</a> </p><p>As a community member, I'd like to highlight a couple of settings that might help. </p><p>The app has a feature to show correspondent names / android contacts, rather than email addresses. This can be turned off within the settings to display the full email address. </p><p>Navigate to general settings &gt; display. <strong>Untick</strong> ""Show correspondent names"" <em>(show correspondent names rather than their email address)</em> </p><p>You can also tick ""correspondent above subject"" to give the email address more prominence. </p><p>The app further allows you to inspect the header of any email. To do this. </p> <ol><li> Open an email </li><li> Click download complete message </li><li> Click 3 dot menu &gt; show header </li></ol> <p>The developers are currently redesigning the message list view. You can see some of the proposals at the link below and share your suggestion. </p><p><a href=""https://thunderbird.topicbox.com/groups/ux/Ta9a415d4e3e807cf/uxd-11-26-updates-mobile-message-list"" rel=""nofollow"">https://thunderbird.topicbox.com/groups/ux/Ta9a415d4e3e807cf/uxd-11-26-updates-mobile-message-list</a> </p>",platform34,false,1,0

The following steps should make Thunderbird for Android display email addresses instead of names (I know this is not exactly what you want): ""Settings"" &gt; ""General settings"" &gt; ""Display"" &gt; ""Message lists"" section &gt; Untick ""Show correspondent names"". </p><p>2.

Being able to show **both the display name and the email address at the same time** (or at least optionally) would significantly improve security and transparency. </p><p>I have upvoted the existing feature request you linked and would strongly support its implementation. </p><p>Thank you for your help and for maintaining Thunderbird for Android. </p>",pc9801es,false,0,0

I think Thunderbird Android being the cause is unlikely based on this. </p><p>Xfinity's website suggests the following. </p> <ol><li> Sign in to Xfinity Email using your Xfinity ID and password. </li><li> In the top-right corner, click the Gear icon, then select Settings. </li><li> Click Security. </li><li> Uncheck the box under Third Party Access Security to prevent third-party programs access to your Xfinity Email, or <strong>check the box to allow access.</strong> </li></ol> <p>If you have Thunderbird desktop working, you likely already have this box checked. </p><p>Sorry I can't help further, other community member's may be able to offer additional suggestions. </p>",platform34,false,0,0
