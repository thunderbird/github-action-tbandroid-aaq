I’d really like to get them <strong>instantly</strong> (or at least much faster). </p><p>A few details: - The email server is my university’s, so it might not have the latest sync features. - I set the folder poll frequency to 15 minutes, and emails do come through fine that way — just too slow. - I also set “refresh IDLE connection” to every 2 minutes. - Running version 13.0 of Thunderbird on Android. </p><p>Is there any way to make Thunderbird fetch or push emails instantly? Or is this delay just how it works if the mail server doesn’t fully support push/IDLE? </p><p>Thanks for any tips or ideas! </p>",sjosch;platform34;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:143.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/143.0;solver_id:6251118,2,0,0,,,
