I don't tend to send many emails from my phone so didn't notice the issues for some time! </p><p>A few weeks ago I ended up changing my email server's password - I updated my PC Thunderbird to reflect the change for incoming and outgoing servers and then thought I did the same on the Android Thunderbird - but I only changed the password for fetching - perhaps missed the sending password as in the Android version its in the account menu rather than a separate ""outgoing server"" menu item. </p><p>Everything seemed ok as I got emails on my phone but yesterday someone complained I'd not replied to some questions and I was sure I'd replied to their email. Looking on my phone today I noticed that there were a handful of unsent messages (including this reply) in the Thunderbird Outbox. </p><p>Basically when I sent each message the connection to the outgoing server failed due to the now out of date password but instead of giving any warning that the connection had failed it had just silently moved the message to Outbox where it remained as the outgoing server connect attempts would continue to fail. Having some form of warning that server connections were failing due to incorrect password would be useful - I think the Windows version will ask for a new password to be entered if a login with the current one fails. Note: the checks when setting the password means you cannot configure the account with a password that fails but if the password changes you get no warning </p>",david33;,true,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:138.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/138.0,0,0,0,,,
