I am finding, as I use TB Android more and more, that some messages - I know coming from gmail but perhaps also others - come in lacking attachments. In the message list I clearly see the paper clip icon. But when the message is opened I see no sign of an attachment anywhere. This is true even when I tap download complete message at the very bottom. But I can easily see it on the gmail website AND if I download the message into TB desktop. </p><p>Anyone have any idea what is happening here? </p><p>Thanks </p>",whitedavidp;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:135.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/135.0;os:Android 12,0,0,0,,,
