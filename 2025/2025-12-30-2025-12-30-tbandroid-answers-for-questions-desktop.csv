You might also think about any other apps you've recently installed. </p><p>If the issue continues after reinstalling, I'd suggest enabling debug logging in the app settings. This should provide more detail about what's happening.

Tried all your suggestions without resolution but your suggestions led me to figure out the outbox and occasionally inbox email blocks were most likely due to Web Guard, a sub feature (antivirus) for my Avast Mobile Security app. I never had this problem with my email account thru my desktop or laptop. So I have disabled this Web Guard on my mobile and all seems to work well now. Again, much thanks for being there and taking this on. God bless! </p>",thomas.peeples,false,0,0

I down loaded new version of Thunderbird for my S23 and when I clicked bird icon on my cell like I had before I deleted version I had new version I downloaded gave me some options of transferring files from version on my laptop Window 10. And one was align the QR.  For some reason I learn using a light bulb does not work with speed or whatever with my S23.  I learned there are some options to slow down or speed up my cell phone but that did not work.  I was going to use same password for my S23 as on my laptop.  Another confusing thing was what codes do I use for incoming and outgoing? Another problem was using my micros password.  I was blocked because of using wrong codes. I have used laptops and cell phones for many years. After sending  this email to you I am going to try again to reset my micros password. I have a Thunderbird icon on my cell phone but no password yet.  This would be a lot easier if I could talk to someone about this.  I went to local  Best Buy, Tmobile, called Ionos and Samsung and not much help. </p>",email14,false,0,0

I believe it has a built in password manager for storing all your email account passwords, with access protected by a single master password. This master password is possibly what you changed. </p><p>You should be able to login to the password manager and find the entry for your Ionis account. Show and note down the Ionos account password and enter it in the mobile app. </p><p>Scanning the QR code would normally fill this information in for you, however it sounds like it's not working for you.  </p><p>You can find some guidance around the QR code process linked below. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-android-import"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbird-android-import</a> </p>",platform34,false,0,0
